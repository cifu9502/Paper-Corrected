(To be written)  




\TS{Focus on Take-home message(THM)}
\begin{itemize} 
\item During the research stage, the THM may
be unclear or change, but during the TS/TSO stage the THM must be clear.

An excellent THM can be shortened to be the \textit{title} of talk/paper.

\item You don't have a THM, until you have simple, clear sentence
expressing it.

\item The THM drives the organization.  When it doesn't, something is wrong
with either it or TS/TSO.
\end{itemize} 


\TS{There must an introductory paragraph that sets the paper in context; in this paragraph the topic sentence can be at the end.}

\LUIS{My comments}

\subsection{Topic sentences}
\label{sec:TopicSentences}

\begin{itemize}

\item Topic sentence is the point of paragraph or a slide.  Whenever a
paragraph/slide is \textit{not} about single point,
\textbf{revise}
either splitting up paragraph/slide or rewriting topic sentence.

\item Several views:

\item TS is 1st sentence of paragraph; introduces main idea of paragraph;
indicates to reader what paragraph is about.
\item Contract between writer and reader: here is idea I want to explain;
all right explain it to me.  Contract means: (i) only one topic that both
understand; (ii) a
limited topic; not more general than supporting evidence in paragraph; (iii) TS directs flow of paragraph.

\item Some of TS functions: (i) announces the topic; (ii) make transition
from previous paragraph; (iii) forecasts sub-topics to be dealt with in
a whole serious of paragraphs.

\item \textbf{Efficiency}. Revision of the plan of paper is much easier and
quicker if you have only to delete or re-order sentences.  
Doing this on the completed draft involves much more work.

\item Since a concept must be explained when it first appears,
interchanging paragraphs will require moving definitions.

\item Paragraphs should smoothly flow into each other.
Reordering paragraphs may require extensive rewriting.


\item \textbf{Writing to length.}  With a sentence outline you can easily
judge how long the manuscript will be and modify it
to keep the essential material within the prescribed length.

\item \textbf{Time} . All the above -- clarity, argument flow,
efficiency, length management -- can be done faster using a sentence
outline.

But \textit{spoken} \textbf{practice}  (before audience if possible) gives
best check on how smoothly you give talk to desired time.

\end{itemize}


How do I write topic sentences?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each sentence must be a sentence -- that is, it has a subject
("each sentence"), a verb ("must be"), and a complement ("a sentence").

\item The sentence should be as specific as possible so that the main
points/features of the paragraph are clear.

\item Each sentence is the "topic sentence*" of the
paragraph and usually appears as the first sentence of the paragraph.

\item If one numbered item contains two sentences, make sure you are
not squeezing two paragraphs into one.  For a paper of n double-spaced
pages, there should be 2n to 3n paragraphs.

\item The sentences should be organized to construct coherent arguments
toward your paper's conclusions. 

\item There must an introductory paragraph that sets the paper in
context; in this paragraph the topic sentence can be at the end.   

\item Generally, the next paragraph presents the principal results or
conclusions to be presented in the text of the paper.

\item The final paragraph should deftly summarize only the
results defended in the body of the paper.

\item The outline should be double spaced.

\item You should include at the end the most important
references you will use.  These can be cited in individual sentences of
the outline, if you want, to make clear where they are relevant.
