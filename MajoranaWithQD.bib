	abstract = {We propose an experimental setup for detecting a Majorana zero mode consisting of a spinless quantum dot coupled to the end of a p-wave superconducting nanowire. The Majorana bound state at the end of the wire strongly influences the conductance through the quantum dot: Driving the wire through the topological phase transition causes a sharp jump in the conductance by a factor of 1/2. In the topological phase, the zero temperature peak value of the dot conductance (i.e. when the dot is on resonance and symmetrically coupled to the leads) is e{\textasciicircum}2/2h. In contrast, if the wire is in its trivial phase, the conductance peak value is e{\textasciicircum}2/h, or if a regular fermionic zero mode occurs on the end of the wire, the conductance is 0. The system can also be used to tune Flensberg's qubit system [{PRL} 106, 090503 (2011)] to the required degeneracy point.},

	abstract = {We investigate quantum transport through a quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire (Kitaev chain) sustaining Majorana end modes. Using a recursive Green's-function approach, we determine the local density of states of the system and find that the end Majorana mode of the wire leaks into the dot, thus, emerging as a unique dot level pinned to the Fermi energy ɛF of the leads. Surprisingly, this resonance pinning, resembling, in this sense, a “Kondo resonance,” occurs even when the gate-controlled dot level ɛdot(Vg) is far above or far below ɛF. The calculated conductance G of the dot exhibits an unambiguous signature for the Majorana end mode of the wire: In essence, an off-resonance dot [ɛdot(Vg)≠ɛF], which should have G=0, shows, instead, a conductance e2/2h over a wide range of Vg due to this pinned dot mode. Interestingly, this pinning effect only occurs when the dot level is coupled to a Majorana mode; ordinary fermionic modes (e.g., disorder) in the wire simply split and broaden (if a continuum) the dot level. We discuss experimental scenarios to probe Majorana modes in wires via these leaked/pinned dot modes.},

Majorana bound states ({MBSs}) are peculiar quasiparticles that may one day become the cornerstone of topological quantum computing. To engineer these states, physicists have used semiconductor nanowires in contact with a superconductor. Although many of the observed properties align with theoretical predictions, a closer look into the creation of {MBSs} is desirable. Deng et al. fabricated nanowires with a quantum dot at one end that served as a spectrometer for the states that formed inside the superconducting gap of the nanowire. Using this setup, topologically trivial bound states were seen to coalesce into {MBSs} as the magnetic field was varied.
Science, this issue p. 1557
Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states ({MBSs}). We demonstrate the emergence of {MBSs} from coalescing Andreev bound states ({ABSs}) in a hybrid {InAs} nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few {ABSs}. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which {ABSs} move to zero energy and remain there, forming {MBSs}. We observed hybridization of the {MBS} with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The {ABS}/{MBS} spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamical and transport features of a Kondo dot side coupled to a topological superconductor ({TS}). The Majorana fermion states ({MFSs}) formed at the ends of the {TS} are found to be able to alter the Kondo physics profoundly: For an infinitely long wire where the {MFSs} do not overlap (εm=0) a finite dot-{MFS} coupling (Γm) reduces the unitary-limit value of the linear conductance by exactly a factor 3/4 in the weak-coupling regime (Γm{\textless}{TK}), where {TK} is the Kondo temperature. In the strong-coupling regime (Γm{\textgreater}{TK}), on the other hand, the spin-split Kondo resonance takes place due to the {MFS}-induced Zeeman splitting, which is a genuine many-body effect of the strong Coulomb interaction and the topological superconductivity. We find that the original Kondo resonance is fully restored once the {MFSs} are strongly hybridized (εm{\textgreater}Γm). This unusual interaction between the Kondo effect and the {MFS} can thus serve to detect the Majorana fermions unambiguously and quantify the degree of overlap between the {MFSs} in the {TS}.},

	abstract = {We have recently shown [Phys. Rev. B 89, 165314 (2014)] that a noninteracting quantum dot coupled to a one-dimensional topological superconductor and to normal leads can sustain a Majorana mode even when the dot is expected to be empty, i.e., when the dot energy level is far above the Fermi level of the leads. This is due to the Majorana bound state of the wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work by investigating the low-temperature quantum transport through an interacting quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side coupled to a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero mode leaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using a recursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime using numerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay between the Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire coupling strengths, gate voltages, and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a “0.5” conductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between the leaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for a wide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressed by Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, is suppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero-bias conductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well-known universality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose that the universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of 0.5e2/h is evidence of the presence of Majorana-Kondo physics. These results confirm that this “0.5” Majorana signature in the dot remains even in the presence of the Kondo effect.},
