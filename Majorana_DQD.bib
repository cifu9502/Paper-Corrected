	abstract = {This review covers several topics involving renormalization group ideas. The solution of the s-wave Kondo Hamiltonian, describing a single magnetic impurity in a nonmagnetic metal, is explained in detail. See Secs. VII-IX. "Block spin" methods, applied to the two dimensional Ising model, are explained in Sec. VI. The first three sections give a relatively short review of basic renormalization group ideas, mainly in the context of critical phenomena. The relationship of the modern renormalization group to the older problems of divergences in statistical mechanics and field theory and field theoretic renormalization is discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V the special case of "marginal variables" is discussed in detail, along with the relationship of the modern renormalization group to its original formulation by Gell-Mann and Low and others.},

	abstract = {Quantum Dot Heterostructures Dieter Bimberg, Marius Grundmann and Nikolai N. Ledentsov Institute of Solid State Physics, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany Quantum dots are nanometer-size semiconductor structures, and represent one of the most rapidly developing areas of current semiconductor research as increases in the speed and decreases in the size of semiconductor devices become more important. They present the utmost challenge to semiconductor technology, making possible fascinating novel devices. This important new reference book focuses on the key phenomena and principles. Chapter 1 provides a brief account of the history of quantum dots, whilst the second chapter surveys the various fabrication techniques used in the past two decades, and introduces the concept of self-organized growth. This topic is expanded in the following chapter, which presents a broad review of self-organization phenomena at surfaces of crystals. Experimental results on growth of quantum dot structures in many different systems and on their structural characterization are presented in Chapter 4. Basic properties of the dots relate to their geometric structure and chemical composition. Numerical modeling of the electronic and optical properties of real dots is presented in Chapter 5, together with general theoretical considerations on carrier capture, relaxation, recombination and properties of quantum dot lasers. Chapters 6 and 7 summarize experimental results on electronic, optical and electrical properties. The book concludes by disoussing highly topical results on quantum-dot-based photonic devices - mainly quantum dot lasers. Quantum Dot Heterostructures is written by some of the key researchers who have contributed significantly to the development of the field, and have pioneered both the theoretical understanding of quantum dot related phenomena and quantum dot lasers. It is of great interest to graduate and postgraduate students, and to researchers in semiconductor physics and technology and optoelectronics.},

	abstract = {The temperature-dependent impurity susceptibility for the symmetric Anderson model is calculated for all physically relevant values of its parameters U (the Coulomb correlation energy) and Γ (the impurity-level width). It is shown that, when U{\textgreater}πΓ, for temperatures T{\textless}U(10kB) the symmetric Anderson model exhibits a local moment and that its susceptibility maps neatly onto that of the spin-½ Kondo model with an effective coupling given by ρJeff=−8ΓπU. Furthermore, this mapping is shown for remarkably large values of {\textbar}ρJeff{\textbar}. At very low temperatures (much smaller than the Kondo temperature) the local moment is frozen out, just as for the Kondo model, leading to a strong-coupling regime of constant susceptibility at zero termperature. The results also depict the formation of a local moment from the free orbital as T drops below U, a feature not present in the Kondo model. Finally, when U≪πΓ there is a direct transition from free-orbital regime for T≫Γ to the strong-coupling regime for T≪Γ. The calculations were performed using the numerical renormalization group originally developed by Wilson for the Kondo problem. In addition to the actual numerical calculations, analytic results are presented. In particular, the effective Hamiltonians, i.e., fixed-point Hamiltonian plus relevant and marginal operators, are constructed for the free-orbital, local-moment, and strong-coupling regimes. Analytic formulas for the impurity susceptibility and free energy in all three regimes are developed. The impurity specfic heat in the strong-coupling regime is calculated.},

Small quantum dots with a large level spacing

In modern quantum dot experiments all parameters of this model can be tuned via external gate voltages. Thus, it should be possible to check our theoretical findings experimentally. 
We are particularly interested in temperatures \$T\$ smaller than the so-called Kondo temperature \$T\_K\$, \$T{\textless}T\_K\$. The Kondo temperature \$T\_K\$ is an energy scale below
which a local spin inside the dot interacts strongly with the conduction electrons in its neighboring leads.
Consequently we employ Wilson's numerical renormalization group method, a numerical technique which allows for an accurate calculation of properties of quantum dots in the Kondo regime.},

The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width (n atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case n=∞ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies (±J,±J′) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc given by the condition sinh(2JkTc) sinh(2J′kTc)=1. The energy is a continuous function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as −log {\textbar}T−Tc{\textbar}. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is (exp (2JkT) tanh(2J′kT))n.},

A self-consistent Hartree-Fock treatment shows that there is a sharp transition between the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state, depending on the density of states of free electrons, the s−d admixture matrix elements, and the Coulomb correlation integral in the d shell; that in the magnetic state the d polarization can be reduced rather severely to nonintegral values, without appreciable free electron polarization because of a compensation effect; and that in the nonmagnetic state the virtual localized d level tends to lie near the Fermi surface. It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate d orbitals and d−d exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.},

The NRG method was later generalized to a variety of quantum impurity problems. The purpose of this review is to give a brief introduction to the NRG method, including some guidelines for calculating physical quantities, and to survey the development of the NRG method and its various applications over the last 30 years. These applications include variants of the original Kondo problem such as the non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the two-channel Kondo model, dissipative quantum systems such as the spin-boson model, and lattice systems in the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory.},

Using a recursive Green's-function approach, we determine the local density of states of the system and find that the end Majorana mode of the wire leaks into the dot, thus, emerging as a unique dot level pinned to the Fermi energy ɛF of the leads. Surprisingly, this resonance pinning, resembling, in this sense, a “Kondo resonance,” occurs even when the gate-controlled dot level ɛdot(Vg) is far above or far below ɛF. The calculated conductance G of the dot exhibits an unambiguous signature for the Majorana end mode of the wire: In essence, an off-resonance dot [ɛdot(Vg)≠ɛF], which should have G=0, shows, instead, a conductance e2/2h over a wide range of Vg due to this pinned dot mode. Interestingly, this pinning effect only occurs when the dot level is coupled to a Majorana mode; ordinary fermionic modes (e.g., disorder) in the wire simply split and broaden (if a continuum) the dot level. We discuss experimental scenarios to probe Majorana modes in wires via these leaked/pinned dot modes.},

Majorana bound states ({MBSs}) are peculiar quasiparticles that may one day become the cornerstone of topological quantum computing. To engineer these states, physicists have used semiconductor nanowires in contact with a superconductor. Although many of the observed properties align with theoretical predictions, a closer look into the creation of {MBSs} is desirable. Deng et al. fabricated nanowires with a quantum dot at one end that served as a spectrometer for the states that formed inside the superconducting gap of the nanowire. Using this setup, topologically trivial bound states were seen to coalesce into {MBSs} as the magnetic field was varied.
Science, this issue p. 1557
Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states ({MBSs}). We demonstrate the emergence of {MBSs} from coalescing Andreev bound states ({ABSs}) in a hybrid {InAs} nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few {ABSs}. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which {ABSs} move to zero energy and remain there, forming {MBSs}. We observed hybridization of the {MBS} with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The {ABS}/{MBS} spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.
Tunneling spectroscopy gives insights into the formation of Majorana bound states in a proximitized indium arsenide nanowire.

The Majorana fermion states ({MFSs}) formed at the ends of the {TS} are found to be able to alter the Kondo physics profoundly: For an infinitely long wire where the {MFSs} do not overlap (εm=0) a finite dot-{MFS} coupling (Γm) reduces the unitary-limit value of the linear conductance by exactly a factor 3/4 in the weak-coupling regime (Γm{\textless}{TK}), where {TK} is the Kondo temperature. In the strong-coupling regime (Γm{\textgreater}{TK}), on the other hand, the spin-split Kondo resonance takes place due to the {MFS}-induced Zeeman splitting, which is a genuine many-body effect of the strong Coulomb interaction and the topological superconductivity. We find that the original Kondo resonance is fully restored once the {MFSs} are strongly hybridized (εm{\textgreater}Γm). This unusual interaction between the Kondo effect and the {MFS} can thus serve to detect the Majorana fermions unambiguously and quantify the degree of overlap between the {MFSs} in the {TS}.},

  abstract     = {We have recently shown [Phys. Rev. B 89, 165314 (2014)] that a noninteracting quantum dot coupled to a one-dimensional topological superconductor and to normal leads can sustain a Majorana mode even when the dot is expected to be empty, i.e., when the dot energy level is far above the Fermi level of the leads. This is due to the Majorana bound state of the wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work by investigating the low-temperature quantum transport through an interacting quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side coupled to a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero mode leaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using a recursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime using numerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay between the Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire coupling strengths, gate voltages, and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a “0.5” conductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between the leaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for a wide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressed by Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, is suppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero-bias conductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well-known universality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose that the universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of 0.5e2/h is evidence of the presence of Majorana-Kondo physics. These results confirm that this “0.5” Majorana signature in the dot remains even in the presence of the Kondo effect.},

The Majorana bound state at the end of the wire strongly influences the conductance through the quantum dot: Driving the wire through the topological phase transition causes a sharp jump in the conductance by a factor of 1/2. In the topological phase, the zero temperature peak value of the dot conductance (i.e. when the dot is on resonance and symmetrically coupled to the leads) is e{\textasciicircum}2/2h. In contrast, if the wire is in its trivial phase, the conductance peak value is e{\textasciicircum}2/h, or if a regular fermionic zero mode occurs on the end of the wire, the conductance is 0.

Here we propose an alternative setup, wherein a topological superconducting phase is driven by applying an in-plane magnetic field to a (110)-grown semiconductor coupled only to an s-wave superconductor. This device offers a number of advantages, notably a simpler architecture and the ability to tune across a quantum phase transition into the topological superconducting state while still largely avoiding unwanted orbital effects. Experimental feasibility of both setups is discussed in some detail.},

Here, we report on the realization of a Nb–InSb nanowire–Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap ΔInSb ∼ 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is Ez ∼ ΔInSb, is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.},

	abstract = {We show that the combination of spin-orbit coupling with a Zeeman field or strong interactions may lead to the formation of a helical electron liquid in single-channel quantum wires, with spin and velocity perfectly correlated. We argue that zero-energy Majorana bound states are formed in various situations when such wires are situated in proximity to a conventional s-wave superconductor. This occurs when the external magnetic field, the superconducting gap, or, most simply, the chemical potential vary along the wire. These Majorana states do not require the presence of a vortex in the system. Experimental consequences of the helical liquid and the Majorana states are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We propose and analyze theoretically an experimental setup for detecting the elusive Majorana particle in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures. The experimental system consists of one-dimensional semiconductor wire with strong spin-orbit Rashba interaction embedded into a superconducting quantum interference device. We show that the energy spectra of the Andreev bound states at the junction are qualitatively different in topologically trivial (i.e., not containing any Majorana) and nontrivial phases having an even and odd number of crossings at zero energy, respectively. The measurement of the supercurrent through the junction allows one to discern topologically distinct phases and observe a topological phase transition by simply changing the in-plane magnetic field or the gate voltage. The observation of this phase transition will be a direct demonstration of the existence of Majorana particles.},

	abstract = {We provide a current perspective on the rapidly developing field of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in solid-state systems. We emphasise the theoretical prediction, experimental realisation and potential use of MZMs in future information processing devices through braiding-based topological quantum computation (TQC). Well-separated MZMs should manifest non-Abelian braiding statistics suitable for unitary gate operations for TQC. Recent experimental work, following earlier theoretical predictions, has shown specific signatures consistent with the existence of Majorana modes localised at the ends of semiconductor nanowires in the presence of superconducting proximity effect. We discuss the experimental findings and their theoretical analyses, and provide a perspective on the extent to which the observations indicate the existence of anyonic MZMs in solid-state systems. We also discuss fractional quantum Hall systems (the 5/2 state), which have been extensively studied in the context of non-Abelian anyons and TQC. We describe proposed schemes for carrying out braiding with MZMs as well as the necessary steps for implementing TQC.},

An exact expression for the transmission coefficient in terms of fully interacting many-body Green's functions is obtained. By mapping the system into an effective Anderson impurity model, one can determine the transmission using numerical renormalization group methods. The transmission exhibits signatures of the different Kondo regimes of the effective model, including an unusual Kondo phase with split peaks in the spectral function, as well as a pseudogapped regime exhibiting a quantum critical transition between Kondo and unscreened phases.},
